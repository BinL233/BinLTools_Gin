### <span style="color:#c7437ccd">2. Thread scheduler</span>

To see the repository, please click [this link](https://github.com/BinL233/Thread-scheduler).

This repository contains code for emulation of a single CPU with 
the Shortest Remaining Time First scheduling policy 
and two IO Devices based thread scheduler.

1. Languages
   - C language
   - Makefile

2. Features
   - Implemented and parsed various mechanisms for virtual memory to 
   physical memory to page mapping and page scheduling algorithms (FIFO, LRU, CLOCK).
   - Implemented multi-process, CPU/IO multi-threading 
   (spin locks, mutex locks, and thread scheduling algorithms (FCFS, SRJF)).
   - implemented A TLB mechanism to determine the 
   physical address of the memory request at the time of the TLB hit.
